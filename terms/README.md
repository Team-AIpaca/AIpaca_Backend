# Terms Directory
This directory contains terms markdown files sorted by language. For example, English language terms files are stored in the en directory.

# Support Language
Currently, only `en` and `ko` languages are supported, and if you want to add more languages, you'll need to translate and save the markdown files with the language name folder and modify `../routes/terms/get.py` and `../routes/terms/post.py`.

# List of terms that need to be translated / modified
If you need to translate or modify, here's a list of the terms files you need to modify:
* `privacy_policy.md`
* `terms_of_service.md`
