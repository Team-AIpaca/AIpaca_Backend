# Translate APIs
The following translation APIs are currently supported:
* DeepL - [deepl](https://pypi.org/project/deepl)
* Google Translate - [googletrans 4.0.0rc1](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans)<sup>The latest version, 3.0.0, didn't work, so I used the pre-release, 4.0.0rc1.</sup>
* LibreTranslate - [libretranslatepy](https://pypi.org/project/libretranslatepy)

# Upcoming support
* Papago - [papygo](https://pypi.org/project/papygo)

# Is API key required
Some services require an API key. Among the currently supported APIs, DeepL requires an API key. You can get an API key from your [DeepL Pro Account](https://www.deepl.com/pro-account).

Papago, which we will support in the future, also requires an API key. You can get one from [Naver Cloud](https://guide.ncloud-docs.com/docs/papagotranslation-use-apis).
